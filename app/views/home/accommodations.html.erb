    <h1>Transportation</h1>
    <p>
      Squamish is located an hour north of Vancouver, along the beautiful Sea-to-Sky Highway. It’s about halfway between Vancouver and Whistler.<br><br>
      Vancouver International Airport (YVR) is the most practical airport to fly in to. From there, the easiest way to get to Squamish is by car, which can be rented at the airport or in the city. There are also several buses and shuttles that make trips to and from Squamish daily.<br><br>

    <h1>Accommodations</h1>
    <p>
      We have booked <%= link_to 'Sunwolf Resort', 'https://www.sunwolf.net/'%> for the entire August 23 – 24 weekend. It is located where the Cheakamus and Cheekye rivers converge, about 15 minutes (15 km) north of the town of Squamish. This is where the all wedding events will take place!<br><br>
      August is a beautiful time for camping in BC. We welcome you to pitch a tent at Sunwolf, free of charge. There are lovely, clean restrooms and showers available for use on site. There is also an area to park trailers, RVs, campervans (you name it), but please note that there are no electric or sewage hookups available.<br><br>
      If you are traveling from afar, and are interested in camping at the venue, you can easily and affordably rent camping gear from a number of places! Check out Mountain Equipment Coop (MEC), Sports Junkies or Rent Outdoors, to start. Please let us know if you plan on camping or parking at Sunwolf, so we know who to expect.<br><br>
      We have created a room block at the <%= link_to 'Howe Sound Inn', 'https://www.howesound.com/copy-of-history-2'%>, with rooms available for $155 + tax. This hotel is within the Town of Squamish, and has a brewery attached to it! Please note that the hotel will only accept reservations for both Friday and Saturday nights.<br><br>
      You can reserve at the Howe Sound Inn by calling them at 604-892-2603, and quoting the booking code <content style='text-decoration: underline;'>082319CC</content>. If these rooms sell out, we will look into expanding to another venue.<br><br>
      If you plan on booking a room at the hotel, please keep your noisier festivities within the brewery, and be mindful of others sleeping at the Inn.<br><br>
      Additionally, there is an array of Airbnbs, luxury accommodations, budget rooms, and hostels throughout the area. Feel free to explore these other options. Summer is very busy in the area, so we encourage you to book a few months in advance.
