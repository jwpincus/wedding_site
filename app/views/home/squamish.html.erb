    <h1>Things to do</h1>
    <h2>Squamish</h2>
    <p>
      Squamish is the ultimate destination for playing outside. There are hikes for all levels, fantastic spots for climbing and bouldering, and many refreshing swimming holes to cool off in after.<br><br>
      One of our favourite low-key things to do in the area is a wander down Eagle Run, along the Squamish River. There's a great chance of seeing bald eagles, seals, and maybe even bears! Other major attractions include the Sea To Sky gondola, which offers stunning views over Howe Sound, and Shannon Falls Provincial Park, where after a very short stroll, you can see a giant waterfall.<br><br>
      For adventure seekers, you can also try white-water rafting, kiteboarding, and bungee jumping.<br><br>
      Squamish is also awesome for just relaxing. There are great breweries, cozy coffeeshops, and good shopping in town. If you want to play inside, the Brittania Mine Museum will take you underground!

    <h2>Whistler</h2>
      <p>
      Keep heading north on the Sea-to-Sky highway for just under an hour, and you'll eventually arrive at Whistler Village. During the summer months, Whistler becomes a mecca for mountain bikers. Gear can be rented in the village, if you want to join in! If not, it's fun to watch them too.<br><br>
      Whistler village is also great for a stroll; there are tons of great shops, restaurants, and bars.<br><br>
      Whistler/Blackcomb is home to the Peak 2 Peak gondola, which provides a pretty epic view from the top of the mountain.<br><br>
      There are awesome hikes throughout the area, for all levels. If you feel like spoiling yourself, soaking in the baths at Scandinave Spa is absurdly beautiful.<br><br>
      If you would like to learn more about the region and it's history, the Squamish Lil'wat Cultural Center has an excellent museum.
